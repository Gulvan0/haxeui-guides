Installing Haxe
================================

Haxe is an open source high-level strictly typed programming language that allows code to be transpiled into various other languages.

HaxeUI, in turn, is built on top of Haxe. The best way to install Haxe is to download the official latest distribution from the [haxe.org](http://www.haxe.org) website and follow any instructions for your operating system.
