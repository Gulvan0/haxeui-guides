Welcome
================================

This guide will serve as a starting point to get your system configured to write rich, cross platform, cross framework Haxe GUI applications.

By the end of this guide you will have a fully functioning HaxeUI installation (with a least one [backend](backends/index.html)) and a simple "[Hello World](hello-world.html)" application.

Use the sections to the left to navigate your way around this guide.
