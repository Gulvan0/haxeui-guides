Backends
================================
A `backend` is the term used to refer to what HaxeUI uses to delegate component creation, event registration and rendering to. The core of the library (`haxeui-core`) handles layout, scripting, binding, invalidation sequence and such common tasks, whilst the backend in question is responsible for actually displaying something on screen, mapping of events from HaxeUI's generic `UIEvent` to something the host backend uses and such framework specific tasks.

In general getting HaxeUI to work with one of the supported backends is fairly trivial and follows these general steps:

* Install `haxeui-core`
* Install haxeui backend library
* Install dependancies of backend libary

Haxelib itself should handle these steps for you. They are only listed here for completeness.
